"""Contract drift detector.

Compares the vendored `director_hub/bridge/_generated_schemas.py` against
what `.shared/codegen/python_gen.py` would produce TODAY. If they differ,
the JSON schemas in `.shared/schemas/` have moved since the vendored
copy was last refreshed and someone needs to re-vendor:

    cp C:/Dev/.shared/codegen/golden_python.py \\
       director_hub/bridge/_generated_schemas.py

The test skips when `.shared/codegen/python_gen.py` isn't reachable
(e.g., CI runs on a hosted runner without the cross-repo checkout).
This means it's a guard for local dev and for CI configurations that
explicitly check out `.shared` as a sibling — not a hard gate that
breaks isolated runs.
